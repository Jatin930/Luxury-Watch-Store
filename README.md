# Luxury-Watch-Store


This is a Luxury Watch store. The languages I used were HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some of the functionality this website has is adding to /deleting from cart, looking at description of item, registering for an account and signing in. This project is made using node.js and MongoDB(for storing username and password.)
